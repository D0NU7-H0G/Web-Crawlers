# Web Dungeons


A RPG/Dungeon crawler that will be made with either Java, HTML5, CSS3 or JavaScript

This is my first attempt at a browser extension game (I did write a basic game i JavaScript and godot some time back). Through this project, I aim to get better at coding in the chosen language and start learning browser game development in general.

This game is currently in development, and there is still quite a bit to be done before it becomes fully playable. Once this game is released, I will make incremental changes a little bit at a time.

## Game goal

This game is a web based dungeon crawler game. As you visit new websites, there is a new "room" to fight in. Each visit to that website earns the owner of that website some gold. When you visit a website that another person owns, you can steal it from them - if you beat them of course. Gold can be used to buy new defences, health potions, or can be saved up to buy a big item, etc. Want to design a top down map - the POV like most .io games.

## Game controls

Use the `arrow` keys to move the player. Left click to attack and right click to use your special. 

## To-Do List:

- [ ] Find a suitable game engine or language to write the game in
- [ ] Design an algorithm that will randomly generate a map for each website
- [ ] Character animation and character design
- [ ] Server hosting (and a way to get it on a browser extension store
- [ ] Game Mechanics/rules
- [ ] Start, pause and game over screens
- [ ] Audio
- [ ] Documentation
- [ ] Final tests

This is also available in my project board which you can find [here](https://github.com/users/D0NU7-H0G/projects/1)
